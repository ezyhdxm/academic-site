== Research Interest
My research primarily focuses on structural matrix estimation and network analysis, with broader interests in machine learning and statistical modeling. I am particularly interested in:

- High-dimensional statistical inference: Developing methods for estimating and analyzing large-scale structured matrices.
- Network analysis: Studying the structure and dynamics of complex networks, including community detection and spectral methods.
- Machine learning theory: Understanding the theoretical properties of learning algorithms in statistical settings.

I aim to develop theoretically sound and computationally efficient statistical methods that can be applied to real-world data in scientific and engineering domains.
